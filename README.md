Learning R Tutorial: A Process-Focused Approach
===============================================

This tutorial is a free resource to help researchers learn R in a way that is more intuitive and easily-accessible. Instead of moving from the simple to the complex, this tutorial provides a dataset and then introduces the concepts needed to import, clean, transform, and analyze that dataset step by step. Thus, the basics are introduced "along the way" as we push toward the goal of analyzing the data. I hope that this can provide a better approach for researchers, who are often stuck between tutorials that are geared toward programmers (teaching the structure of R without dealing much with statistical functions) and tutorials geared toward researchers (focusing only on the statistical functions, with little coverage of the basic structures of R). Both are needed for researchers to use R successfully, effectively, and efficiently. But I hope that the approach of this tutorial will provide the necessary concepts in a way that answers the question, "Yes, but how do I use that for my own data?"
